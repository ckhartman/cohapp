                <li>Account Registration. At the time you request an invitation code to become a Registered User of the 
                  Services, you may be asked to provide us Personal Information including your email address, username 
                  so we can create an account for you. Your provision of any Personal Information is voluntary. However, 
                  if you choose not to provide the information requested, certain aspects or elements of the Services 
                  may not be available to you.</li>
                  <li>Contact Us. If you send us emails such as customer support inquiries, we may maintain those communications 
                    and their contents so that we can resolve your inquiries or otherwise assist you. We use the Personal

Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser, if you so allow, that enables the Services’ or our or our service provider’s systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. This technology typically does not personally identify you or extract information from your computer. We may use Cookies to provide an enhanced online experience, to monitor and measure the use of our Site and to improve the Site’s design and content. The type of information collected may include browser information, operating system, type of computer, internet service provider and other similar information.

You may visit the third-party links below to opt out of their tracking and learn about their privacy practices.

            </ul></li>
            <li>Data Security
            <p>City of Hope makes extensive use of technologies and techniques to help protect the integrity of the Personal Information you provide to us via the App. Still, you should be aware that electronic communications may not always be secure, in spite of all precautions. If you are concerned about providing sensitive information, you may wish to do so via phone, regular mail or during a personal consultation, rather than electronically. We have reasonable safeguards in place to protect your information, and we have taken the following security measures:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Transport Layer Security (TLS) - We use TLS encryption when transmitting certain kinds of information through the App from your mobile device to our server. An icon resembling a padlock is displayed in most browsers during TLS sessions. When you send text messages or emails to your friends, family or other individuals in your contact list, those messages or emails are outside of our control and are not encrypted. Alerts and reminders sent to your mobile device are also not encrypted.</li>
                <li>Secure Storage - We deploy reasonable and appropriate industry standard physical, technical, and administrative safeguards to protect your Personal Information.</li>
                <li>Vendors and Partners - To protect the security and privacy of your information, we may provide information to partners and vendors who work on our behalf or with us and require them to agree to maintain the confidentiality of your information.</li>
                <li>Access to Information - We limit access to Personal Information to those employees who reasonably need access to such information in order to provide you with services and process your information appropriately.</li>
              </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Data Retention
            <p>We will retain your Personal Information for the length of time needed to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. We may retain de-identified data for an indefinite amount of time for research and development purposes.</p>
          </li>
          <li>How We Disclose Personal Information and Anonymous Data
            <p>
              We may share Personal Information with service providers and governmental agencies or as otherwise described below:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Providers and Unaffiliated Third Parties. We may share your Personal Information with Providers in order for them to provide services and products you requested.</li>
              <li>Service Providers. We may share your Personal Information with affiliated and unaffiliated companies that perform tasks on our behalf related to our business. Such tasks include managing and analyzing this Site or mobile application usage data, customer service, trouble shooting by accessing users’ systems remotely (with users’ consents), electronic and postal mail service, contests/surveys/sweepstakes administration, marketing services, social commerce and media services (e.g., Facebook, ratings, reviews, blog), and payment processing services. Third-party service providers receive your Personal Information as necessary to perform their role, and we instruct them not to use your Personal Information for any other purposes.</li>
              <li>Professional Advisors. We may share your Personal Information with our auditors, lawyers or other professional advisors so they can support our business. Like the other service providers, these professional advisors are bound by contractual obligations to keep Personal Information confidential and use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them.</li>
              <li>As Required by Law. We will disclose your Personal Information as necessary or appropriate, including to providing information as required by law, regulation, subpoena, court order, legal process or government request; to enforce our Terms of Use, including investigations of potential violations thereof; to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect your safety or the safety of others; to protect our rights, to investigate fraud, or to respond to a government request.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>How We Disclose Anonymous Data
            <p>The Anonymous Data you provide allows us to perform analysis, research and generate the appropriate statistics relevant to you. We may share this Anonymous Data with other research affiliates, agents, and business partners, to better understand our users as well as to improve the content and functionality of the App and the Site. Collecting this information also allows us to perform technical research and development, improve the App and the Site, and develop new features or services.</p>
            <p>We may conduct research on our end user’s demographics, interests, and behavior based on the Anonymous Data. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis. We may share with its affiliates, agents, and business partners this “aggregated” data, compiled from the information that it collects from users. These aggregate data do not identify you personally. We may also disclose aggregated data in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes. Although these aggregated data do not identify users personally, there is a risk that third parties who receive such data from us may re-identify specific users. Prior to sharing any Anonymous Data with third parties, we will secure in writing the express written agreement of such third parties that they will not attempt to re-identify the information to any particular individual.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Children
            <p>We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 13 and do not target the Site or the App to anyone under 18. If you are under 18, you should not attempt to use the Services or provide any data to us. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Data to us, please contact us (webmarketing@coh.org), and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Disclaimers
            <p>This App is designed for informational and educational purposes only. It should not be construed as medical advice nor should it be used for diagnostic or treatment purposes. If you feel you have a health problem, please consult a medical professional. This App is not a substitute for professional care. If you have or suspect you have a health problem, please consult a medical professional.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Your Choices
            <p>We strive to maintain the accuracy of any Personal Information that may be collected from you, and will use our commercially reasonable efforts to respond promptly to update our database when you tell us any such information in our database is not accurate. It is your responsibility to ensure that such information is accurate, complete and up-to-date. You may obtain from us, by email or mail, the information in our records and/or files. If you wish to make any changes to any Personal Information you have provided to us, you may do so at any time by contacting our mobile application development team. You may opt out of receiving communications from us and our affiliates by following the opt-out link provided in any email received from us or by contacting us here. If you close your Registered User account, we will no longer use your online account information or share it with third parties. We may, however, retain a copy of the information for archival purposes, and to avoid identity theft or fraud.</p>
            <p>We do not currently recognize automated browser signals regarding tracking mechanisms, which may include “do not track” instructions. Therefore, we will not treat you differently if we receive such settings from you.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Updates to This Privacy Policy
            <p>We may periodically update this Privacy Policy to describe new Services features, products or services we offer and how it may affect our use of information about you. If we make material changes to this this Privacy Policy, we will post a notice on the Services prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices. We will not make any materially different use or new disclosure of your Personal Information to another entity using your Personal Information for that entity’s own purposes unless we notify you and give you an opportunity to object.</p>
